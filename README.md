## CCS2240-Week-5-MAs
#### This Bakery algorithm corrects the bug in last weeks Bakery algorithm (by declaring the local variable h to be of type int and not of type byte).
#### p1 is safety property because its violation occurs in finite time ("there exists a time t such that...").
#### p2, p3, and p4 are liveness properties. Spin provides two alternatives ways for checking liveness properties: pan and pan -a. When the verifier is invoked through pan (without the -a switch), Spin does assume fairness in the environment; fairness here means that all processes in the system are given a chance to execute and make progress, ensuring that no process is unfairly starved of opportunities to advance. When the verifier is invoked through pan -a, Spin does not make such fairness assumptions - instead, it exhaustively explores all possible executions of the system, regardless of whether they are fair or not. Clearly, the latter approach, the so-called automata-theoretic approach, is more appropriate when verifying liveness properties in scenarios where fairness cannot be guaranteed in the environment. Thus, p2 and p3 verify with both pan and pan -a, whereas p4 verifies only with pan and not with pan -a. The reason for this is that p2 and p3 vacuously hold in environments in which a process (say P0) is never given the opportunity to make any progress. p4 on the other hand is violated if P0 makes no progress.
